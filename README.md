# wikifoundry-script
Untaint is a user script that improves the Wikifoundry (formerly Wetpaint) wiki interface and integrates TinyEditor. The script allows for RTF tags, images, links and Youtube videos to be embedded in posts. In addition, the script alters some styling to make navigation easier for higher activity members. This version works with GreaseMonkey 0.9+, Firefox 4+ and Chrome 10+ (requires Tampermonkey for Chrome version 33). Also, runs in Scriptish. Not currently tested in IE or Opera.
